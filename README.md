### ~~Not even beta release. Pre-alpha. Always ;)~~ Obsolete app. Use Anki
This little script helps learning new words or remembering already known vocabulary.

#### Usage:

Start: `./lywon.pl db/example`

Quit: type `;;;` as answer

#### Bugs/todo/to fix:
* Rewrite whole script
* Does input file exist?
* Is input file in proper format?
* Quit after SIGQUIT (Ctrl+D) signal instead of `;;;`
* Better screen clearing
* Save stats
